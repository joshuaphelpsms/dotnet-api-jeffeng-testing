# This file is required for the deployment of the application in the platform. Contact
# the platform management team to determine the available application templates and
# their corresponding values.

#template:

# Provides a reference to a template defined in the platform
# A template declares a set of values for application configuration.
# For instance, an API exposed publically is a type of we application that 
# can be referenced externally using an FQDN
#
# An example could be:
# template: external-service
template: <PlatformTemplateName>

# values:
# Provides a collection of key value pairs consisting of those
# values that the specific template declares.
# In the case of an external service described above, the values could be:
values:

  # The FQDN by which the application could be publicly accessed, like
  # fqdn: sampleapp.acompany.com
  fqdn: <FQDN>

  # The image specification including tag of the container image to use, like
  # image: ghcr.io/acompany/sampleapp:latest
  image: <Image:Label>

  # The name of the app to be used, like
  # app: dotnet-api-template
  app: <Name>

  # The port on the container where the app can be accessed, like
  # port: 5000
  port: <Port>

  # Other relevant values as defined in the template. In this example, cpu, memory, and 
  # replicas are all that the application developers must specify
  cpu: 1
  memory: 256M
  replicas: 3
